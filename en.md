Welcome!

That's why this list has been created : to help you to save some privacy by replacing default apps.

## F-Droid

[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org) is an open source app store in which you can exclusively download open source apps.
I recommend you to use it to download the following apps!

## Alternatives to Google apps

### Play Store

* Aurora Store ([Official Website](http://auroraoss.com/) - [Download on F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/app/com.aurora.store)) : This is an open source implementation of the Play Store : you'll found the same apps. *Warning! Use only app generated accounts, and not your personal account, as long as it can be banned! This meant that you only can install free Play Store apps, not paid ones!*
